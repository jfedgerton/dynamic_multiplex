# dynamicmultiplex 1.0.0

Initial CRAN release.

* Multilayer community detection via Louvain or Leiden on evolving networks,
  with interlayer coupling built from Jaccard similarity, overlap coefficient,
  node-strength weighted variants, or direct node identity links
  (`fit_multilayer_jaccard()`, `fit_multilayer_overlap()`,
  `fit_multilayer_weighted_jaccard()`, `fit_multilayer_weighted_overlap()`,
  `fit_multilayer_identity_ties()`).
* User-specified layer connectivity via `layer_links`, enabling adjacent-only
  temporal coupling.
* Explicit objective selection (CPM or modularity) via the `objective`
  argument; negative edge weights are rejected for modularity-based methods.
* Bayesian bootstrap confidence intervals for community assignments
  (`bootstrap_multilayer()`, `community_ci()`).
* Simulation utilities for benchmarking (`simulate_and_fit_multilayer()`).
* Visualization helpers: layer series plots (`plot_multilayer_series()`),
  alluvial diagrams (`plot_multilayer_alluvial()`), and animated GIFs
  (`animate_multilayer_gif()`).
